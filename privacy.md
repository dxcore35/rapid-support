# Privacy Policy for Rapid

Effective date: February 11, 2026

Rapid is a local-first reading app. We designed it to work without creating an account.

## Data we collect

Rapid does not require account signup and does not collect personal profile information by default.

The app stores reading data on your device, such as:

- Library items you add (PDF, URL, text)
- Reading progress and session history
- App settings (for example WPM, pauses, haptics)

## How your data is used

Your data is used to provide core features like resume progress, reading statistics, and settings persistence.

## Data sharing

Rapid does not sell your data.

If you use system sharing features (for example Share Sheet or Siri Shortcuts), the content you choose to share is handled by Apple platform services according to your device settings.

## Data retention

Data remains on your device unless you delete it from the app or uninstall the app.

## Children

Rapid is not directed to children under 13.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy as the app evolves. Changes will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
